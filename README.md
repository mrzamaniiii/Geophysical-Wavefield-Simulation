# Geophysical-Wavefield-Simulation
A collection of MATLAB simulations for acoustic wave propagation in geophysical imaging. Covers phenomena like Mie scattering, beamforming with acoustic lenses, layered refraction, and wave focusing. These models illustrate key seismic effects such as attenuation, reflection, and velocity-based wave behavior.
