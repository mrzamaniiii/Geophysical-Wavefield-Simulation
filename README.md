# Geophysical Imaging Simulations

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB simulations for modeling acoustic wave propagation in geophysical environments.  
Each script demonstrates different physical phenomena relevant to seismic imaging and subsurface exploration.

## ðŸ§ª Simulated Phenomena

- **Mie Scattering**: Wave attenuation due to sub-wavelength velocity perturbations.
- **Beamforming & Acoustic Lens**: Focused wavefields using source array delays and parabolic reflectors.
- **Layered Refraction**: Modeling of seismic wave bending in multi-layer media with velocity gradients.
- **Scattering & Obstacles**: Wave behavior in presence of high-speed anomalies and reflectors.

|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mie_scattering_simulation.m`    | Simulates attenuation from Mie scattering in noisy regions. |
| `beamforming_lens_model.m`       | Demonstrates focused waves using a curved high-speed lens.  |
| `layered_refraction_model.m`     | Simulates wave refraction through a multi-layered model.    |
| `scattering_with_obstacle.m`     | Shows reflection and scattering due to a velocity anomaly.  |

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- MATLAB R2021a or later
- Custom function: `acu2Dpro` (provided separately or from course materials)

## ðŸ“¸ Sample Outputs

- Seismic traces with/without attenuation
- Focused energy at desired depth
- Reflected waves from lens and obstacles

## ðŸ“š Context

These scripts were developed as part of lab projects in a *Geophysical Imaging* course.  
They aim to provide intuition and visualization for wave-based imaging techniques used in exploration geophysics.
