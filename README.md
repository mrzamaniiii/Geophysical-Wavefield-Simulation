# Geophysical Imaging Simulations

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB simulations for modeling acoustic wave propagation in geophysical environments.  
Each script demonstrates different physical phenomena relevant to seismic imaging and subsurface exploration.

## 🧪 Simulated Phenomena

- **Mie Scattering**: Wave attenuation due to sub-wavelength velocity perturbations.
- **Beamforming & Acoustic Lens**: Focused wavefields using source array delays and parabolic reflectors.
- **Layered Refraction**: Modeling of seismic wave bending in multi-layer media with velocity gradients.
- **Scattering & Obstacles**: Wave behavior in presence of high-speed anomalies and reflectors.
